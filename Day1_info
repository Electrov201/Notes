**Day 1: Introduction to Ethical Hacking & Information Security**

 Ethical Hacking & Cyber Security Fundamentals
## **1. Information Security (InfoSec)**

### **What is Information? (Difference between Data & Information)**

* **Data**: Raw facts, figures, and symbols without context
  * Example: "Computer" - just a word without meaning
* **Information**: Processed, organized, and structured data that provides context and meaning
  * Example: "This is my computer" - data with context that makes sense

**Key Characteristics of Information:**
* Timeliness - Available when needed
* Accuracy - Correct and free from errors
* Completeness - Contains all necessary details
* Relevance - Applicable to the current context

**NOTE:** When information exists in digital systems, protecting it becomes the domain of Cyber Security (information involving cyberspace).

## **2. Information Security Threats**

A threat is a potential danger to an asset that could result in unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction.

### **Types of Threats:**

1. **Inadvertent Threat** – Unintentional human errors
   * Accidental data deletion
   * Misconfiguration of systems
   * Falling for phishing scams
   * Weak password practices

2. **Physical Threat** – Environmental dangers
   * Natural disasters (floods, earthquakes, fires)
   * Power failures
   * Temperature extremes
   * Physical theft or damage

3. **Technical Failure** – System malfunctions
   * Hardware failures (disk crashes, network equipment failure)
   * Software bugs or glitches
   * System crashes
   * Network connectivity issues

4. **Deliberate Acts** – Intentional malicious activities
   * Hacking and unauthorized access

## **3. Introduction to Cyber Security**

### **Information Security vs. Cyber Security**

**Information Security does NOT deal with:**
* Cyber Warfare (Government-sponsored attacks, critical infrastructure attacks)
* Information Warfare (Propaganda, psychological operations)
* Negative impacts of people on internet (cyberbullying, online harassment)
* IoT Security (Specialized domain requiring specific expertise)

**Cyber Security Deals With:**
* Protection of cyberspace against cyber threats
* Safeguarding information that travels through cyberspace
* Primarily focuses on deliberate acts
* Does NOT typically address physical/personal security
* Concerned with threats *via* cyberspace, not threats *for* cyberspace

### **Objectives of Cyber Security**

* **Confidentiality:** Preventing unauthorized access to sensitive information
  * Implemented through encryption, access controls, authentication

* **Integrity:** Ensuring data remains accurate and unaltered
  * Maintained through checksums, digital signatures, version control

* **Availability:** Guaranteeing data and systems are accessible when needed
  * Achieved through redundancy, load balancing, disaster recovery

* **Non-repudiation:** Preventing denial of actions
  * Enabled through digital signatures, audit logs, certificates

* **Authenticity:** Verifying the identity of users and systems
  * Implemented through multi-factor authentication, digital certificates

## **4. The CIA Triad**

The CIA Triad forms the foundation of information security principles:

### **1. CONFIDENTIALITY**

* Broader concept than privacy
* Ensures sensitive data is not disclosed to unauthorized parties
* Guarantees that authorized users can access appropriate information

**Implementation Measures:**
* **Encryption**: Converting data into unreadable format
  * Symmetric encryption (AES, DES)
  * Asymmetric encryption (RSA, ECC)
* **Authentication**: Verifying user identity
  * Something you know (passwords, PINs)
  * Something you have (tokens, smart cards)
  * Something you are (biometrics)
  * Multi-factor authentication (2FA/MFA)
* **Access Control**: Limiting system access to authorized users
  * Role-based access control (RBAC)
  * Principle of least privilege
* **Physical Protection**: Securing physical assets
  * More sensitive data requires stronger physical security

### **2. INTEGRITY**

* Ensures data remains consistent, accurate, and trustworthy
* Prevents unauthorized modification of data
* Maintains data validity throughout its lifecycle

**Implementation Measures:**
* **Backups**: Creating copies of data for recovery
  * Regular backup schedules
  * Testing backup restoration procedures
* **Checksums & Hashing**: Verifying data integrity
  * MD5, SHA-256, etc.
  * Detects any changes to data
* **Cryptographic Methods**: Protecting data integrity
  * Digital signatures
  * Message authentication codes (MAC)
* **Access Control**: Preventing unauthorized modifications
  * Read-only permissions where appropriate
  * Change management processes

### **3. AVAILABILITY**

* Ensures data and systems are accessible when needed
* Critical for business continuity and operations
* Requires proactive maintenance and planning

**Implementation Measures:**
* **Firewall Rules**: Protecting against DoS attacks
  * Rate limiting
  * Traffic filtering
* **Patch Management**: Keeping systems updated
  * Regular security updates
  * Vulnerability remediation
* **Disaster Recovery**: Planning for system failures
  * Redundant systems
  * Failover mechanisms
  * Recovery time objectives (RTO) and recovery point objectives (RPO)
* **Load Balancing**: Distributing network traffic
  * Content Delivery Networks (CDNs)
  * Cloud services (Cloudflare, Akamai)
  * Server load balancers (Nginx, HAProxy)

## **5. What is Hacking?**

* No universally accepted definition
* Often misrepresented in media as purely malicious
* Context and intent determine whether hacking is ethical or unethical

### **Types of Hackers:**

1. **White Hat Hackers (Ethical Hackers)**
   * Authorized to test systems for vulnerabilities
   * Work to improve security
   * Follow legal and ethical guidelines

2. **Black Hat Hackers**
   * Unauthorized access to systems
   * Malicious intent (theft, disruption, etc.)
   * Operate outside legal boundaries

3. **Gray Hat Hackers**
   * May violate laws but without malicious intent
   * May report vulnerabilities without permission
   * Operate in ethical gray areas

4. **Hacktivists**
   * Hack for political or social causes
   * May use cyber手段 to promote their agenda

5. **State-Sponsored Hackers**
   * Working on behalf of governments
   * Engage in cyber espionage or warfare

---

## **6. Information Warfare**

* The tactical and strategic use of information to gain advantage over adversaries
* Historically involved physical intelligence gathering and military operations
* Modern information warfare includes:
  * Psychological operations
  * Disinformation campaigns
  * Cyber attacks on critical infrastructure
  * Economic espionage

**Government Investments:**
* Intelligence agencies (CIA, NSA, MI6, etc.)
* Cyber warfare units
* Advanced persistent threat (APT) groups

## **7. Security Terminologies**

* **Vulnerability**: A weakness or flaw in a system that can be exploited
  * Examples: Unpatched software, weak passwords, misconfigurations

* **Threat**: A potential danger that could exploit a vulnerability
  * Can be a person, organization, or event
  * Examples: Hacker, malware, natural disaster

* **Risk**: The potential for loss or damage when a threat exploits a vulnerability
  * Calculated as: Risk = Probability × Impact
  * Risk management involves identifying, assessing, and mitigating risks

* **Asset**: Something of value that requires protection
  * Can be data, systems, hardware, reputation, etc.
  * Asset valuation helps prioritize security efforts

* **Bug**: An error or flaw in software that causes unexpected behavior
  * Not all bugs are security vulnerabilities
  * Some bugs can be exploited to compromise systems

* **Exploit**: Code or technique that takes advantage of a vulnerability
  * Can be a piece of software, a sequence of commands, or a methodology

* **Zero-day Exploit**: An exploit targeting a previously unknown vulnerability
  * No patch or fix exists when first discovered
  * Highly valuable in both offensive and defensive security
